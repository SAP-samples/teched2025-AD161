# Workarounds

## For Preparation 2 - Setup workspace

If for some reason you cannot clone the repository, download the repository content as _zip_
and unpack it.

1. In your browswer, navigate to the repository for
[teched2025-AD161](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-AD161).

2. Download the repository content as _zip_ file.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/wa_00_02_0010.png)

    It will probably be stored as file _teched2025-AD161-main.zip_ in directory _C:\Users\TE-XX\Downloads_.

3. Move the _zip_ file to folder _C:\Users\TE-XX_ (replace `XX` with the number assigned to you.)

4. Unzip the file, e.g. in Windows Explorer:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/wa_00_02_0020.png)

    The content will be extracted into a new folder _teched2025-AD161-main/teched2025-AD161-main_.

5. The cloned repo contains a folder _ws_ where you
will be developing the CAP applications. Go to that folder and start VS Code.

    ```sh
    cd C:\Users\TE-XX\teched2025-AD161-main\teched2025-AD161-main\ws
    code .
    ```



## For Preparation 4 - Copying 

If you dowloaded the repository content as zip file, you find the assets in folder
_C:\Users\TE-XX\teched2025-AD161-main\teched2025-AD161-main\assets_.
